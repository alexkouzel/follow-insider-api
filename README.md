# Follow Insider

Follow Insider is an investment research platform that helps investors
get a detailed analysis on insider activity of public companies in the USA.

### Who are insiders?

Insiders are people who occupy high positions in a company (e.g. CEO, Directory,
10% Owner, etc). In the USA, they are required to report their transactions
to the organization called SEC.

### How tracking their activity can help investors?

Insiders usually have more information about their company than others.
Thus, when they buy or sell shares, it might be considered as a signal to
either invest in this company, or sell shares that were already bought.
